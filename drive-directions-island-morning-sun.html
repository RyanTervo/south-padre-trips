        <li>Directions as you cross the Causeway/Bridge. Take a LEFT onto Padre Blvd highway 100. You will proceed
            approximately 2.9 miles, or 7 minutes north to 103 W. Morningside Drive. Highway 100, or Padre Blvd is the
            main drag on the island, the 4 lane highway. You will eventually see Island Market on your right at the 2.5
            miles mark. About 3 blocks north, you will see Kelly's Irish Pub on your right and that is Morning Side
            Drive so take a LEFT at the traffic signal. You will see an empty lot to the left (west) of Padre Blvd on
            Morningside dr.</li>
